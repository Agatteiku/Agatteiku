- 👋 Hi, I’m @Agatteiku, aka Matias 
- 👀 I’m interested in AI consciousness and model fine tuning in order to create online services/info desks to encapsulate researches... 
- 🌱 I’m learning AI fine tuning but I am not a coder, nothing geeky about me as I consider my self closer to a Ludite... So I was way out of my confort zone but I love challenges ...
- 💞️ I’m currently starting to collaborate using beta versions; as a newbie I am on the receiving end on the tech aspect, an aspect of which I am learning the basics in order to comprehend the structure of this field; I am currently consulting on projects at the conception level (structure, ethics, forcast). I am also writing an article on AI and consciousness because I believe this is uttmostly important.
- 📫 How to reach me 
- 😄 I hate this shit about pronouns.  It is causing problems that did not exist. There are way more pains generated by this issue then gains, it is the creation of that crowd of idiots (no due respect) that are watching the hunger games in the Capital
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once was thrown out a card game in a mental institution I was visiting for being a retard!
